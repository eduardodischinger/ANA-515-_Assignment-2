#Section 1 - The dataset is about professional tennis players and the amount of time they add or subtract by point to the match lenght. The data was collected from a repository created by analyst/statistician Jeff Sackmann, who posted to Github the tennis stats of the last 25 years. Then it was measured the avreage lenght of points in a professional tennis match; the dataset contains data about 219 tennis players and the average time they add or subtract to a tennis points in comparison with the avreage tennis point lenght. The data is in a CSV file
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/tennis-time/players_time.csv"
tennis <- read.csv(url)
#Using read.csv(url) I was able to read the dataset into R
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library("dplyr")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}

rename(tennis, time =seconds_added_per_point)
```

This dataframe has `r nrow(tennis)` rows and `r ncol(tennis)` columns. The names of the columns and a brief description of each are in the table below:

```{r}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
Names = c("player","seconds_added_per_point"),
Description = c("pro tennis player for column 1","time they add or subtract for the average lenght of a tennis point for column2")
)
text_tbl
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
data_pick <-select(tennis, seconds_added_per_point)

```

```{r, include=TRUE}
summarytable<- summary(data_pick)
print(summarytable)
```
